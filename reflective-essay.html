            <h2> Reflection</h2>
            <p>
            If I were visiting Earth prior to 1500 I would say that Mesoamerica were more advanced than Africa. My criteria for this would be mostly based on artistic and mathematical skills, as well irrigation systems.
            While many may say that Mesoamerica lacked important features like “metal working, the wheel…and heavy transportation” (Upshur et al. 387), I would argue that all they were able to do while still lacking these is amazing. They still were able to create large civilizations that included amazing irrigation systems and buildings, our book even states that the Aztecs dam in Tenochtitlan was “…an engineering marvel” (Upshur et al. 360), which I think shows how much they were able to create without certain items which shows a lot of ingenuity.
            My final criteria is the advancement of irrigation systems, while Africa and Mesoamerica needed advanced irrigation systems Mesoamerica was far more advanced. The Mayans were able to create “… canals in swampy areas alongside raised plots of earth…” (Upshur et al.356). They created these canals which drew in moisture through capillary action in areas under jungle-canopies (Upshur et al.356). This is rather amazing in terms of agriculture when one considers how odd that would be for a jungle area, but they were able to create these systems in order to support a large population. Another Mesoamerica group that created an advanced irrigation system is the Aztecs. They created a dam and aqueducts so they could have fresh water for crops, and they also created artificial islands for their food to grown on taking the Mayans irrigation system one-step further (Upshur et al.360). Being able to create a dam and aqueducts is pretty amazing, especially when you consider how important both of those are to us in 2019 for irrigation purposes to make sure we are able to keep our crops watered. They also were smart enough to create islands for their crops that had to have had some amazing irrigation system either connecting to the aqueducts or having another complex system to keep all of the crops on these islands alive.
            These amazing art and mathematical skills as well as very advanced irrigation systems prove why the civilizations of Mesoamerica are more advanced than Africa during this time period, as no civilizations in Africa had such advancements.

            While both African and Mesoamerican civilizations had wonderful artwork made out of gold, copper, and other metals, only certain Mesoamerican civilizations, specifically the Moche, had created metal artwork that was also colored in some fashion (Upshur et al. 365, 382). This to me may be an indication that Mesoamerica was more advanced as it would take a lot of knowledge, effort, and ingenuity in order to create colors and then be able to add them onto metal pieces.
            Another advancement that Mesoamerica had over Africa was math. The Mayans were able to create two different calendars, a 260-day year calendar that ran parallel to the solar year and a linear calendar that went all the way up to 142 nonillion years (Upshur et al. 357). As far as we know there were no African civilizations that had created a calendar of any kind. Another way they were mathematically advanced was that with all of their calculations they also had the number zero which helped make their calculations more accurate, and this is considered to be very powerful (Upshur et al. 357).
